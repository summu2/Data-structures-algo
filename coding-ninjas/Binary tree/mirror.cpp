/*Code : Mirror
Send Feedback
For a given Binary Tree of type integer, update it with its corresponding mirror image.
Example:
Alt text

Input Format:
The first and the only line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.
Output Format:
The only line of output prints the mirrored tree in a level-wise order. 
Each level will be printed on a new line. Elements printed at each level will be separated by a single line.
Note:
You are not required to print anything explicitly. It has already been taken care of.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Time Limit: 1 sec
